This program needs OpenHardwareMonitor to run
Visit below to download
https://openhardwaremonitor.org/files/openhardwaremonitor-v0.9.6.zip

It is recommended to run as admin, but doesn't need it
Only tested in Windows 10

I created this as a replacement for Task Manager, to provide what I think is the relevant information for when you're gaming
Open to constructive feedback! I want to make this better for myself and anyone else who wants to use it

Current issues as of March 2023
-Doesn't update every 500ms (0.5s), roughly updates every 2000ms (2s)
-Cannot be run directly from python. Windows terminal keeps popping up everytime it is updated
^^Would really love feedback on how to fix this issue
I have tried saving the file as .pyw with no luck

To run this program:
Download files to same folder
Run "RunScript.VBS"
